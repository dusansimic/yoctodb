# Simple document based database
Like MongoDB

## Core
The core of this module is a simple library that offers a set of functions to store objects (documents) into a simple database. Those objects can be inserted, queried, updated and deleted. The idea is to make this module as small as possible so it would be easy to run it on very small projects or Node.js apps.
